DNA methylation is a process that can affect gene accessibility and therefore gene expression. Methylation can affect genes that are associated with suppressing or contributing to tumor growth and progression. I used DNA methylation dataset to develop cancer prediction tool and identify biomarkers. The TCGA-BRCA dataset is used for this analysis. I have used two feature engineering methods (ANOVA F-Test and Random Forest) to reduce the dimensionality so that our deep learning model works better on the dataset. Also, normalizing the data and handling the data imbalance has proved to increase the model's performance much better. SMOTE technique was used to handle the oversampling in the dataset.
