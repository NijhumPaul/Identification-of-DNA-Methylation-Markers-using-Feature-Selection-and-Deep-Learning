DNA methylation is a process that can affect gene accessibility and therefore gene expression. Methylation can affect genes that are associated with suppressing or contributing to tumor growth and progression. I am using patterns in methylation to improve cancer prediction accuracy. The TCGA-BRCA dataset is used for analysis. I have tested two feature engineering methods (ANOVA F-Test and Random Forest) to reduce the dimensionality so that our deep learning model works better on the dataset.
